			<p>This is it. My first public website (that has an actual purpose). So, what's the plan for this site?</p>
<p>Well, I made this site for one main purpose right now: documenting my progress developing a game from scratch using <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> and <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">Raylib</a>. Game development has always been a side project that I've wanted to delve into, but I've either lacked the knowledge (in mainly mathematical fields) or the motivation to do so. Enter this site!</p>
<p>Now, I have the peer pressure from people I don't know to keep me motivated to finish this project. Even though I'll likely never interact with anyone who sees this article, I'm now hoping that my problems of knowledge and laziness are solved.</p>
<p><em>I don't care about your blog site. What's the plan for the game???</em></p>
<p>Good question! I don't have a plan! Yes, unfortunately in all the years that I've wanted to invest time into game dev, I've never thought about <em>what</em> I should put in this game. So why not put everything I want in this game? I'm talking 3d graphics, fancy shaders, the works! Worst case scenario: I scale back to the maximum that I can do. Best case scenario: I test my skills to the absolute limits and get back a product I feel proud of.</p>
<p>But, why Odin and Raylib? Well, I've programmed too much in higher level languages, and returning to C, Odin, or (yes I know it's not super low level, but it's better than the others) Rust always makes me feel good when I program. In terms of choosing Raylib, I'm not a super hardcore programmer that wants to manually edit the framebuffer, and Raylib offered a good balance of being hands off and providing features that I'd like to not do manually.</p>
<p>So, please follow along with my blog. I don't have an rss or fancy email bot to notify you of these changes, but I am planning on posting these updates on Twitter (I'm not listening to the neo-nazi on what it's called) in case you somehow want to receive updates. Hopefully I'll change that in the future and put this garbage content on all the platforms that you enjoy, but for now, I hope you enjoy my journey.</p>
